Welcome to Curriculum Caddy!
============================

This tool is here to help you understand concepts and ask questions related to your class. To get the most out of Curriculum Caddy, keep the following in mind:

*   **Ask Ada** - The "Ask Ada" page is where you will talk to Curriculum Caddy. Ada is a tutor that is designed to help you with anything you need for this class. Ask Ada to explain different terms you heard in class, homework problems you are struggling with, or any other questions that come to mind. Here are some examples of things you can ask:

    * "I don't understand this term: [insert term]."
    * "Can you give an example of [concept]?"
    * "Why is my code not working: [describe your problem]?"
    * "Help me study [unit or lesson]."
    * "Quiz me on [concept]."

*   **Settings** - Be sure to add your name on the settings page so Ada knows who she is working with!

Remember, don't be afraid to make mistakes! Ada is here to help you and won't judge what you know or don't know. Also, don't be afraid to ask your teacher if you are unsure about something.

Happy Learning! ðŸ˜Š
