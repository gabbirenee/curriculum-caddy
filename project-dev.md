# Project Development Process
In this file, I will document the steps that I am taking through the development process and various learnings that I stumble across. 

## Environment Setup
10/10/2024 - I opted to use the [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) bootstrap since it comes with everything you need to build an effective website with React. 

## Architecture/UI Draft
10/14/2024 - Sketched out a basic plan (the lowest fidelity one can get) for what the UI will look like. Additionally, I created a basic structure for what the React component structure will look like. This file is attached as `UI and Architecture Plan.pdf`.
