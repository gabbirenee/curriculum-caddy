            <li><b>Curriculum</b> - The real benefit of Curriculum Caddy comes in when you upload your lesson plans or curriculum into the tool. This gives the AI context into what you are learning in the classroom, allowing it to provide both students and teachers more targeted answers and guidance. Here is the process of adding curriculum into the tool:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Upload your lesson plans or curriculum as a PDF. </li>
                <li>The AI will read through your document and generate lesson objectives, key terminology, and the skill level required for the lesson. </li>
                <li>Review the details that the AI fills in and make edits as needed. Remember, this is what will be given to the AI to provide it context into your curriculum so it's important to get the details right. </li>
                <li>Click Save and your curriculum will be uploaded. </li>
                <li>Alternatively, if you don't have PDFs to upload, you can enter in the details for each lesson or unit manually.</li>
            </ol>
            <li><b>Settings</b> - This is where you can adjust both your personal and classroom settings. Personal settings include things like your name while classroom settings include the subject of your class, grade level, and preferred programming language (if applicable).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your students can also use Curriculum Caddy. Ada will act as a tutor and will guide them to the answers using examples and follow-up questions. To help your students get the most out of the tool, try the following techniques:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encourage students to use Curriculum Caddy for homework, projects, exam prep, and free time in class. </li>

            <li>Assign specific questions to have your students ask the tool when going through homework. </li>
            <li>Encourage them to follow-up with you if they have questions about anything that Ada tells them. </li>
